    <h1>Movies Application</h1>

    <p>
        This is the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web <br>
        application will provide users with access to information about different <br>
        movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their <br>
        personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
